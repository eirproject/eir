//! # Receive construct
//! A receive statement is represented as several intrinsics that
//! interact to represent the receive operation semantics of erlang.
//!
//! It consists of 3 operations, `receive_start`, `receive_wait`
//! and `receive_done`. They are always called in this pattern:
//!
//! ```ignore
//!          v
//!     receive_start
//!          |
//!          v
//!     receive_wait <------------
//!     |          |             |
//!  timeout    check_msg   no match on
//!     |          |          message
//!     v          v             |
//!          control flow to  ----
//!          match on message
//!                |
//!          message matches
//!                |
//!                v
//!            receive_done
//!                |
//! ```
